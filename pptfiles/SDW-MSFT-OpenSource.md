- Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software
  (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly
  accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see
  fit.

- Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative
  way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source
  software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than
  its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather
  than a single author or company.

- Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches
  beyond software production. The open source movement uses the values
  and decentralized production model of open source software to find new
  ways to solve problems in their communities and industries.
