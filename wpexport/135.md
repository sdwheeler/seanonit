The PowerShell ActiveDirectory module has a lot of great features that I
use on a daily basis. However, there is one shortcoming that I have
struggled with for a while. I did a lot of internet searching and
testing to see if I was missing some hidden secret. But, alas, this is
one task that the AD module does not do. Here is the scenario. We have a
lot of AD Groups (Distribution Lists) we use for notification messages.
We want to send notifications to mobile devices. We do this by sending
an email to the devices email address. For example:

    2065551212@mobilecarrier.xyz.com

These external email addresses are created as Contact objects in AD. The
problem is that the cmdlets for managing AD group objects only allow you
to add objects that have a SamAccountName (and therefore a SID) to a
group. This is fine for user and group objects. But Contact objects to
not have SIDs. So now what do you do. The answer is you do it the old
way you would have done it in VBScript; use ADSI. \[code
language="powershell" title="Add Contract to Group Membership"\]
$dlGroup = \[adsi\]'LDAP://CN=DL-Group Name,OU=Corp Distribution
Lists,DC=contoso,DC=net' $dlGroup.Member.Add('CN=mobile-username,OU=Corp
Contacts,DC=contoso,DC=net') $dlGroup.psbase.CommitChanges() \[/code\]
