# Title

This is a simple example of a markdown file. It contains a few different elements that are commonly
used in markdown files.

## Major heading 1

You can use ATX Headers to divide your content into sections. The number of `#` characters at the
beginning of the line indicates the level of the header. For example, `##` is a level 2 header.

> This is an example of a blockquote. It is often used to highlight a quote or a section of text.
> You create a blockquote by adding a `>` character at the beginning of the line. This markup was
> common in the early days of email and is still used in many email clients.

### Subheading

This is an example of a subheading. You create subheadings by adding more `#` characters at the
beginning of the line. For example, `###` is a level 3 header.

Unordered list

- **bold text**
- _italic text_

## Major heading 2

Numbered list

1. Numbered list item 1
1. You don't have to increment the numbers. The markdown processor does that for you.
