Hi, my name is Sean Wheeler. My interest in computers started in 1978 when I first learned to
program in BASIC from a book without access to a computer. My first computer was the Netronics ELF
II built from a kit. It had 256 bytes of RAM.

Later, I saved up my money and bought an Apple //e. This got me through my first two years of
college. By then, the PC Clone market was starting to heat up and I bought a Turbo XT clone, the
first of many PCs I would own. In college I studied Computer Science and worked as a system operator
for the university's VAX cluster. I loved the DCL scripting language in VMS. After graduation, I got
into NetWare. That paid the bills for several years. In February of 1995, I hired by Microsoft to
support Windows (WFW 3.11, LanMan 2.x, NT 3.1, & NT 3.5) for large corporate customers.

These days I am a writer for PowerShell on Microsoft Docs. I have a long history with scripting
languages. I have taught several courses on VBScript and PowerShell over the years. PowerShell is my
current favorite.
