## About me

![Sean D. Wheeler:left::round][05]

Hi, I'm Sean Wheeler.

I'm the lead documentarian for [PowerShell][02] at Microsoft. For over 25 years at Microsoft, I've
delivered many workshops on scripting, debugging, and advanced troubleshooting. Using scripting, I
created tools to help customers collect and analyze data used to troubleshoot and optimize their
environments.

My interest in computers started in 1978 when I first learned to program in BASIC from a book
without access to a computer. My first computer was the Netronics ELF II built from a kit. It had
256 bytes of RAM.

Later, I saved up my money and bought an Apple //e. This got me through my first two years of
college. By then, the PC Clone market was starting to heat up and I bought a Turbo XT clone, the
first of many PCs I would own. In college I studied Computer Science and worked as a system operator
for the university's VAX cluster. I loved the DCL scripting language in VMS. After graduation, I got
into NetWare. That paid the bills for several years. In February of 1995, I hired by Microsoft to
support Windows (WFW 3.11, LanMan 2.x, NT 3.1, & NT 3.5) for large corporate customers.

## About this blog

![Blog logo:left][06]

I started this blog to share my the things I have learned during the course of my career in IT.
The logo and the name were meant to reflect the "IT" part of my career.

Most of the content here is about PowerShell However, I will also write about other topics that
interest me. So the the "IT" may just become "it".

I hope you find it useful.
