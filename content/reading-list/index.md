## Books on writing

#### Writing Without Bullshit by Josh Bernoff

- [Buy on Amazon][06]
- [Other books][02]
- [Blog][01]

"_Writing Without Bullshit_ is the first comprehensive guide to writing for today's world: a noisy
environment where everyone reads what you write on a screen. The average news story now gets only 36
seconds of attention. Unless you change how you write, your emails, reports, and Web copy don't
stand a chance."

This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn how to write for business. It's a quick read,
filled with tons of examples and practical advice. This is the first book on writing that was
immediately useful to me. The blog is also a great resource.

#### The Global English Style Guide by John R. Kohl

- [Buy on Amazon][10]

"This detailed, example-driven guide illustrates how much you can do to make written texts more
suitable for a global audience."

This is a great resource for anyone who writes for a global audience. The rules outlined in the book
are clearly defined with examples. Each rule also includes a rationale for why it's important and
strategies for avoiding common translation pitfalls. I keep my copy on my desk and refer to it
often.

#### The Handbook of Technical Writing by Alred, Oliu, and Brusaw

- [Buy on Amazon][09]

"The _Handbook of Technical Writing_ uses smart, accessible language to spotlight and clarify technical
writing today. Hundreds of topic entries, 90+ sample documents, at-a-glance checklists, and clear,
explicit models, communicate the real-world practices of successful technical writers."

This is another book that I keep on my desk. It's a great reference for technical writers. This is a
reference book I use it to look up specific topics, as opposed to a _Writing Without Bullshit_,
which is a book that you read cover to cover.

## Books on PowerShell

#### PowerShell 101 by Mike F. Robbins

- [Buy on LeanPub][03]
- [Read it online][05]

This is an entry-level book for anyone wanting to learn PowerShell. This book focuses on PowerShell
version 5.1 running on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 in a Microsoft Active Directory domain
environment. However, the basic concepts apply to all versions of PowerShell running on any
supported platform.

This book is available for free online. You can also buy it on LeanPub. If you buy it on LeanPub,
the profits are donated the [OnRamp scholarship program][14] to help bootstrap others into the
industry.

#### Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches by Plunk, Petty, Leonhardt, Jones, & Hicks

- [Buy on Amazon][11]

"_Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches_ is a task-focused guide for administering your systems
using PowerShell. It covers core language features and admin tasks, with each chapter a
mini-tutorial you can easily complete in under an hour. Discover how PowerShell works on different
operating systems, and start automating tasks so they take just a few seconds to complete. No
previous scripting experience required."

This is the book that everyone in the PowerShell community recommends. It's a great way to start
learning PowerShell by solving real-world problems. The latest edition has been update for
PowerShell 7.

#### Windows PowerShell in Action by Bruce Payette & Richard Siddaway

- [Buy on Amazon][12]

"Written by language designer Bruce Payette and MVP Richard Siddaway, this rich book offers a
crystal-clear introduction to the language along with its essential everyday use cases. Beyond the
basics, you'll find detailed examples on deep topics like performance, module architecture, and
parallel execution."

This is definitive reference on how PowerShell works, outside of the
[PowerShell Language Specification][04], which is was also written by Bruce Payette.

## Books on business

#### Radical Candor By Kim Scott

- [Buy on Amazon][13]

"The idea is simple: You don't have to choose between being a pushover and a jerk. Using Radical
Candor—avoiding the perils of Obnoxious Aggression, Manipulative Insincerity, and Ruinous
Empathy—you can be kind and clear at the same time."

This book teaches you how to give feedback to your team in a way that is both kind and clear.

#### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni

- [Buy on Amazon][07]

"Equal parts leadership fable and business handbook, this definitive source on teamwork by Patrick
Lencioni reveals the five behavioral tendencies that go to the heart of why even the best teams
struggle. He offers a powerful model and step-by-step guide for overcoming those dysfunctions and
getting every one rowing in the same direction."

All of Lencioni's books are written as a novel that teach the business lessons through storytelling.

#### The Phoenix Project

- [Buy on Amazon][08]

"In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story
that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT
organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again."

This is the book that started the DevOps movement. It's a great story that teaches you benefits of
DevOps and how to get started. Like _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_, this book is written as a
story. It makes reading about IT fun.
