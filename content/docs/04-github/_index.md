# Taming Git and GitHub with PowerShell
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->

This presentation was built based on a demo and talk that I did for the Reasearch Triangle
PowerShell Users Group (RTPSUG).

- I cover the essentials of setting up and configuring Git for efficient version control. I show how
  to install and use the **posh-git** module, a versatile Git integration for PowerShell.
- I illustrate the Git and GitHub Workflow, covering concepts like repositories, commits, and pull
  requests, and show how they all fit together.
- I discuss the process of forking a repository and cloning it to your local machine. This essential
  skill will enable you to contribute to projects and collaborate effectively with others.
- In the [YouTube video][01], I show how to work with **branches** and _how_ and _why_ to **rebase**
  your commit history. I also cover how to keep your repository clean.
