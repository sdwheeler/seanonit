![Basic markup][01]

## Design philosophy

"A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's
been marked up with tags or formatting instructions." - from John Gruber's [philosophy][02] for
Markdown.

Take a moment to view the [simple-example.md][03] file in GitHub for a simple example of Markdown
and how it's rendered.

By design, Markdown syntax elements are comprised of punctuation characters. The characters were
carefully chosen to convey meaning. For example:

- Asterisks around a word actually look like **emphasis**
- Markdown lists look like lists
- Blockquotes look like quoted passages of text

  > "... assuming you've ever used email"

Compare the plaintext (Raw) view to the syntax-highlighted view (Code) to the rendered view
(Preview).
