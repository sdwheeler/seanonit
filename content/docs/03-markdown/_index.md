  - PowerShell+DevOps Summit 2024 - Bellevue, WA

This presentation covers the essentials of Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text
formatting syntax. Markdown is designed to be easily readable in plaintext and easily convertible to
HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion
forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Goals

The goal of this presentation is to explain what Markdown is and what it's used for, provide a brief
overview of the markup syntax, and teach you where to find more information.
