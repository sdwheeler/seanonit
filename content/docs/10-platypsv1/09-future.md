![Future roadmap?][01]

- GA plans - no target date
  - Driven by internal partner requirements
  - Shipping on quality
- Add more metadata discovery (e.g. validation attributes and values)
- Conversion to other formats (HTML, HelpInfo objects?)
- Localization support
- Support for more structured formats
- Can we make Help use markdown-based content?
