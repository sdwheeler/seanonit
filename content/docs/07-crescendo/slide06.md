![Step 2 - Choose the native command](images/crescendo/slide06.png)

- Start with the help for each subcommand
- Get sample output for each subcommand
- Analyze the output to determine which bits of information are important to you
- Look for patterns that make it easy to identify which line of data you are working with
- Look for natural delimiters that separate labels from data in the output
- VSSAdmin is a good choice
  - It has decent documentation
  - The output is structured well
